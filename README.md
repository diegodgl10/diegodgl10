I am a student of [Computer Science](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/estudiar-en-ciencias/estudios/licenciaturas/ccomputacion) in the Faculty of Science.

My first big approach to computing was thanks to videogames, now my future plans are to promote free software and transmit knowledge through games.

The main programming languages / platforms in which I work are:
- Java
- Haskell
- LaTex
- Android Studio
